# Z2-math-library
A C++ classes for dealing with Z2 field and polynomials with coefficients in Z2

There are two classes which represent
* the field of integers modulo 2 (class Z2) and
* the field of polynomials in this field (class Polynomials).

Class *Z2* overloads in particular operators of
* addition,
* multiplication and
* division.

Class *Polynomial* overloads in particular operators of
* addition,
* multiplication,
* division and
* division modulo another polynomial.

Files .h contain declarations of classes an all the methods while files .cpp contain their definitions.
